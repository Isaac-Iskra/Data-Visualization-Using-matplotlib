Data Visualization Using matplotlib

The code displayed is what I learned from "Python: Machine Learning" by Wei-Meng Lee

I learned how to use matplot lib to plot the different types of charts that are useful for discovering patterns and relationships in a daatset.  A complementary library, Seaborn, simplifies plotting more sophisticated charts.  Such charts include Bar, Scatter, Line, Pie, and the action of adding charts together.
